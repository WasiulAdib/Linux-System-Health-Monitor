 Linux System Health Monitor

I made this simple project to get hands-on experience with system monitoring tools and Command Line Interface(CLI) commands. 

Features that I've put in 

-  RAM usage report
-  CPU load averages
-  Disk space usage
-  Logged-in users
-  System uptime
-  Top memory-hogging processes
