 Linux System Health Monitor

I made this simple project to get hands-on experience with system monitoring tools and Command Line Interface(CLI) commands. 

Features that I've put in 

-  RAM usage report
-  CPU load averages
-  Disk space usage
-  Logged-in users
-  System uptime
-  Top memory-hogging processes

This screenshot shows : 

Logged-in Users Report: displays the list of users currently logged into the system, as reported by the script. 

RAM Usage Report: presents the current memory usage statistics, including used and available RAM.

Disk Usage Report: shows the disk space usage of the system's mounted partitions.        

5/ [The screenshot Shows the top memory-consuming processes. Unsurprisingly, Chrome made the list during testing.](screenshots/Top_5_Memory_Using_Processes(1).png)()
